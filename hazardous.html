The best thing to do right now is to keep yourself busy and active to stay cheerful and look after your body at the same time. While it's normal to start binge-watching shows or sit glued to your laptop during times like this, we strongly recommend you move around a bit more, play a few sports and you're bound to feel a lot better physically and mentally.</p>

Fansipan peak is located in the clouds, it is easy to rain. The best time to conquer this mountain is in the autumn from September to December and the summer from April to June. This is the time when it is not too cold and the summer storms have not.</p>

                <p class="text-justify" style="margin-top:10px ;">When climbing, the body is very easily dehydrated. Mild and normal dehydration can be restored by drinking certain beverages to replace lost salt and quality. Always filtering water is good for the body. Fruit juices, milk, and water are great choices. After intense training or intense activities like rock climbing, a drink can be a great addition, not only to compensate for the loss of water loss, but also to replenish it. electrolytes and sodium for the body. But always stay away from caffeinated and stimulant drinks (such as coffee, tea and sodas) as we tend to pull water from the body and accelerate dehydration.</p>

The most important thing is to always pay attention to the leader of the group. If, after going a part, you find the road strange and difficult to go, you need to turn back immediately. If you get lost and lose the ability to determine the direction, it is best not to continue, but stay there and wait for someone to find it, both to avoid energy consumption, accidents, and for the rescue team to easily locate. your missing more. Must remember to be very calm and focused to be able to find the group.</p>

                <p class="text-justify" style="margin-top:10px ;">The climbing road is full of trees and moss, easy to slip, just a little carelessness can be a very dangerous slip and fall. Therefore, it is very necessary to equip the correct equipment such as shoes, climbing gloves, and learn climbing skills before hitting the road. In the case of a steep slope, you follow the slope to advance in a Z shape, use both hands to support by clinging to rocks, trunks, roots... But remember to test the firmness of these the object that you use as a fulcrum.</p>

                <p class="text-justify" style="margin-top:10px ;">There are all kinds of terrain in Fansipan, from wading streams to climbing slippery waterfalls, from open forests with muddy mud underfoot to clinging to tree roots to climb up. A fitness that is practiced with the right way of breathing will help you a lot. Before climbing Fansipan, you should have about 3 months of regular training such as walking on a gentle slope with a backpack about 5 kg on your back or climbing stairs. In many cases, climbers have fainted from exhaustion or caught cold due to their inability to adapt to the humid weather in the jungle.</p>

                <p class="text-justify" style="margin-top:10px ;">Currently, there are three main roads leading to the top of Fansipan. The first is to go from Tram Ton, the road is easy, short and the least dangerous. The second is from Cat Cat, the longest road, more terrain but also more interesting. The third road is from Sin Chai, almost twice as far as the road from Tram Ton, and also more dangerous with cliffs that require you to master the techniques of walking and climbing.</p>

                <h3>9.&nbsp;Not knowing the basic skills when going to the jungle</h3>
                <p class="text-justify" style="margin-top:10px ;">When climbing, you must always follow small groups, about 4-5 people at the same pace. </p>
                <p class="text-justify" style="margin-top:10px ;">Absolutely do not separate the group because the road on the mountain is easy to get lost. If you accidentally lag behind, try to look in the direction of the person ahead. If you meet a fork and you don't know where to go, you should look for the shoe tracks or broken branches left by the previous person. Or you stand on the spot, call and wait for the person to come back to pick you up. Each group should have someone to close the group, all members of the group should pay attention to each other often.</p>
                <p class="text-justify" style="margin-top:10px ;">Do not arbitrarily eat fruits and leaves in the forest if you do not know for sure about its use. Going to the tropical jungle must have insect repellent such as mosquitoes and squeegees.</p>
                <p class="text-justify" style="margin-top:10px ;">Drinking water is extremely important, so always carry a personal water bottle with you. Water with glucose added a little salt or C effervescent will help you stay strong. When you are too tired, you should stop resting against the mountain, do not sit as soon as you are tired, which can easily lead to muscle tension and cramps. Breathe in through your nose and exhale slowly through your mouth to regulate your breathing.</p>

                <p class="text-justify" style="margin-top:10px ;">Backpacks should choose light materials, always have a raincoat or a few pieces of rain cover. Raincoats should be used in sets for easy travel. Food such as chocolate candy, dry food, drinking water are items you need to bring with you.</p>
